## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

The mod is based on the adventures of Drizzt Do'Urden. I've taken some liberties and the main story is pulled out from a hat. The mod puts in Drizzt and his companions as playable NPC's and you'll be able to play with him through the old and new quests. The mod contains several new big quests and adds in four new cities/villages/towns. There are many smaller quests and some of the quests have different possibilities for endings, including the main story.

More information can be found on the website (link is at the bottom of the file). (Please note, that some parts of the website are very old, including the screenshots which were taken in 2002).

**Key features:**
- Big main story involving Drizzt and the main character.
- 30-40 hours of additional gameplay.
- More than 35 new quests.
- More than 160 new areas.
- 10 new NPCs.
- More than 400 new creatures.
- Hundreds of new items.
- 20+ new kits.
- New spells (mostly kit-specific).
- Special features (check the website).
- Mod maker's house (Use codes and enter area "RA4400").
- SECRETS!!!!


<details><summary>History: original readme from from Gilgamesh (v1.0A)</summary>
<p>
I began working on this mod in Spring 2002. It is almost completely done by me and the work took 2,5 years. It was a hobby for me and I worked when I felt like it.<br>
TDD and EE were the only mods out when I began working and I have been using mostly the same methods as in those mods (which are nowadays old-fashioned). However hopefully some people will be able to enjoy the mod.<br>
The mod was sheltered by TEAMBG for a long time but after they shut down I moved to FORGOTTEN WARS. I received most of the help I needed from the TEAMBG forums.<br>
I don't speak English as my first language and I've grown a lot during the creation of the mod so you may be able to notice some differences in style here and there. I've tried to use as good English as possible but it is not too great. I hope it won't bother anyone much.<br>
Everything you'll find from the mod is just improvisation. Ideas that have sprung up from my mind that I have then created in the game. The Final Fantasies have had some influence for example.<br>
Unfortunately I didn't like modding and finished only because I refused to quit. The ToB compatibility and NPC dialogs (banters) were never done.<br>
If they are to be done, I won't be the one who does them.
</p>

<details><summary>History: a note from King Diamond (v2.0)</summary>
<p>
As a big lover of all that is really BIG :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: I've decided to give this mod another chance to survive in the modern environments (you know - "generation Pepsi", "Greece - European Champions" and stuff...). So, here is another humble attempt not to screw anything that is supposed to work properly.<br>

Some installation notes:

- If you want to install RoT along with TDD you can't use Kit Packs from both mods. Plz choose wich one you want to install. In any case, install RoT AFTER TDD v1.10 (or later).
- Don't forget to install the latest Worldmap mod from Yacomo/Weigo (v6 or later). Local RoT's WMP just doesn't know about any other mod existence.<br><br>

Cheers,<br>
and stay heavy,<br>

## <a name="components" id="components"></a>Components

The installer includes the following components. The number of each is the component *DESIGNATED* number which gives it a fixed install position, lets other components and mods detect it and allows automated installers to specify component choices.  
All optional subcomponents require the main component (they need to since it's the one that installs new content).<br /><br />


#### 0. Main component

This component installs the mod itself.</br>

## 

#### 1. Region Of Terror Kit Pack

This component requires the main component to be installed.</br>

- People who played the original or were involved into its development will be really surprised by some *audible* aspects of the mod (do you?...)

As a big lover of all that is really BIG :P I've decided to give this mod another chance to survive in the modern environments (you know - "generation Pepsi", "Greece - European Champions" and stuff...)
So, here is another humble attempt not to screw anything that is supposed to work properly.
1st, as you may already realized, a size of the mod was dramatically reduced from >600Mb to near 328Mb without loosing *anything*.
2nd, all *technical* compatibility issues with many large mods are solved. You may expect flawless functionality together with BGT-WeiDU 1.00, CtB v1.7, TDD v1.10, SOS v1.10, TS-BP v6.04.01
There *could* be some minor plot inconsistencies here and there, but plz don't rely on that too much. ;)
3rd. RoT now requires full ToB installation (sorry, no SoA-only support - we're delivering only the best! :D )
4th. People who played the original or were involved into its development will be really surprized by some *audible* aspects of the mod (do you?...)
5th. This version includes all original patches.

Some installation notes:

 - if you want to install RoT along with TDD you can't use Kit Packs from both mods. Plz choose wich one you want to install. In any case, install RoT AFTER TDD v1.10 (or later);

 - don't forget to install the latest Worldmap mod from Yacomo/Weigo (v6 or later). Local RoT's WMP just doesn't know about any other mod existence.
